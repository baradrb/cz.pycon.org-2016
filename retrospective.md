PyCon CZ 2015 - retrospective
=============================

### Ideas collected from survey:

1. food was terrible. Only cold food, nothing for vegetarians
2. rather expensive
3. venue was great

### Improvements for next year:

1. find a better supplier for food and provide warm lunch with options for vegans and vegetarians
2. extend conference up to 4 days and try to keep the same price
3. keep the same venue
