    conference devoted to the Python language. It is organized by a handful of 
    passionate members of Czech Python community, with cooperation of the PyVec.org, 
    a local non-profit organization that focuses on supporting the Python Community 
    in Czech Republic. 
    </p>

    <h2 id="the-short-version">Time and Venue</h2>

    </p>

    <h2 id="the-short-version">Objective and Mission</h2>
    <p>
    The objective of the conference is to raise participants' qualifications, 
    and overall integration of the Python Programmers' Community in Czech Republic 
    and surrounding area, popularisation of new applications of the language as 
    well as to spread good programming practices and exchange of experiences 
    between professionals, novices, students and hobbyist Python programmers. 
    PyCon CZ events are also fantastic networking opportunities and a great 
    place to find interesting Python jobs or community projects to work on.
    </p>

    <h2 id="the-short-version">Target Audience</h2>
    <p>
    The conference is addressed to all Python programmers, experienced and novices 
    alike. Presentations will cover a wide range of topics relevant to students, 
    professionals and hobbyists alike. Women who are interested to learn more about 
    python can also participate in DjangoGirls! This year we are expecting more than 
    400 participants. The majority are likely to be Czech locals. With Brno and Czech 
    Republic so centrally located in EU though, and the fact that the Czech organizer 
    team so diverse and well connected, you can expect many visitors from Slovakia, 
    Austria, Poland, Germany, Hugary, UK and more as well.
