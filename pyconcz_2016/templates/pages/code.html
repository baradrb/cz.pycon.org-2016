    <p>
      <strong>PyCon CZ</strong> is a community conference intended for
      networking and collaboration in the developer community. We value the
      participation of <strong>each member</strong> of the <strong>Python
      community</strong> and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and
      fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show
      <strong>respect</strong> and <strong>courtesy</strong> to other attendees
      throughout the conference and at all conference events, whether officially
      sponsored by PyCon CZ or not.
    </p>
    <p>To make clear what is expected:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>All delegates, attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and
        volunteers at any <strong>PyCon CZ</strong> event are required to
        conform to the following Code of Conduct.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Organizers will <strong>enforce</strong> this code throughout the event.
    </p>

    <h2 id="the-short-version">The Short Version</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>PyCon</strong> is dedicated to providing a harassment-free
      conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual
      orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or
      religion.
    </p>
    <p>We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.</p>
    <p>
      All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience
      including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and
      imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Be
      kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave
      professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or
      exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for PyCon.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference
        without a refund at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.</p>

    <h2 id="the-longer-version">The Longer Version</h2>
    <p>
      Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
      orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
      sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
      following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
      talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome
      sexual attention.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
        immediately.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar
      activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular,
      exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other
      material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized
      clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and
      other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive
      swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for PyCon.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct,
      the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate,
      including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no
      refund.
    </p>
